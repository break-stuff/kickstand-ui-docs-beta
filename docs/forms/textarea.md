# Textarea

A `textarea` is for adding multi-line plain-text editing. This is very useful when you want to allow users to enter a large amount of free-form text, for example a comment on a review or feedback form.

<div class="my-xl">
    <ks-form-field
        label="Comments"
        type="textarea"
        value="This is a test!"
        />
</div>

```html
<ks-form-field
    label="Comments"
    type="textarea"
    value="This is a test!">
</ks-form-field>
```

## Usage

For more information on how to use the `form field` component and it's available configurations, check out the [documentation](./form-field.md).
