# Responsive Embed design Tokens

These are the default aspect ratios for the [Responsive Embed component](../components/responsive-embed.md). You can add or remove aspect ratios to suit your custom video or embed aspect ratios and the changes will automatically be reflected in the component.

```scss
$responsive-embed-aspect-ratios: (
  (21, 9),
  (16, 9),
  (4, 3),
  (1, 1)
);
```
